# Analysis
1. What does each row in the data represent?

2. What did you learn about the dataset when you calculated the state with the lowest cases (and what does that tell you about testing your assumptions in a dataset)?

3. Is the location with the highest number of cases the location with the most deaths? If not, why do you believe that may be the case?

4. Why are there so many observations (counties) in the variable lowest_in_each_state (i.e., wouldn't you expect the number to be ~50)?

5. What surprised you the most throughout your analysis?
