# Analysis

**What does each row in the data represent?**

  _Each row in the data represents the following: county, state, dates, cases, flips and         deaths._

**What did you learn about the dataset when you calculated the state with the lowest cases (and what does that tell you about testing your assumptions in a dataset)?**

  _The states with the lowest cases was Northern Mariana Island, my assumption would be that     the island may not be as populated as some of the other areas the data was collected from     which can be tested by adding the population size for each area._

**Is the location with the highest number of cases the location with the most deaths? If not, why do you believe that may be the case?**

  _Yes, the location with highest number of cases is also the location with the most deaths._

**Why are there so many observations (counties) in the variable lowest_in_each_state (i.e., wouldn't you expect the number to be ~50)?**

 _Difference in population sizes of the counties could be a reason for variation in             observations. Counties with smaller population may have limited spread over larger           counties._

**What surprised you the most throughout your analysis?**

  _I was suprised by our overall ability to be able to track the cases, when the pandemic       began it seemed like everything was out of control, it's a nice suprise to see that we do     have some control and data collection is critical at times like this._
